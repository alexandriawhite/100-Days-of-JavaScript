# 100-Days-of-JavaScript

## Introduction

Hello fellow learners! Welcome to my "100 Days Of JavaScript" journey. I've embarked on this exciting adventure to strengthen my JavaScript skills and build amazing web projects. This project-based course is designed to guide me through a wide range of projects, enhancing my understanding of JavaScript while allowing me to apply what I learn in practical scenarios.

## Course Overview

I'm currently enrolled in the [100 Days Of JavaScript course](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-javascript/learn/lecture/25860574#overview) on Udemy. This course aims to take my JavaScript proficiency to the next level by providing hands-on experience through various projects.

## Day 1: [Counter App](https://alexandriawhite.github.io/Counter-App/)

This simple but essential project introduced me to the basics of DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript. By interacting with buttons, I could increment, decrement, and reset a counter's value.

## Day 2: [Random Number Generator](https://alexandriawhite.github.io/Random-Number-Generator/)

This project challenged me to generate random numbers within a specified range and display them. It's exciting to see how JavaScript's random functions can be applied to create interactive and useful features.

## Day 3: [Random Hex Color Generator](https://alexandriawhite.github.io/Random-Hex-Color-Generator/)
This project taught me how to manipulate colors using JavaScript. I learned how to generate random hex values, update the background color of a page dynamically, and enhance user interactivity through a button click event.

## Day 4: [Modal/Pop-up Markup](https://alexandriawhite.github.io/Modal-Popup-Markup/)
I created an interactive user interface by building a Modal Popup Markup which gave me hands-on experience in designing and implementing modal popups using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Day 5: [Palindrome Checker](https://alexandriawhite.github.io/Palindrome-Checker/)
The Palindrome Checker helped deepen my understanding of string manipulation and logical operations in JavaScript. I learned how to reverse a string and compare it with the original to determine if they are the same, thus identifying palindromes.
